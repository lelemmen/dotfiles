### Defining shortcuts for commands

alias resource="source ~/.bash_profile"
alias rr='rm -rf'
alias g='git'

## Give a better version of ls
# -G: enable colorized output (equivalent to export CLICOLOR=1)
# -F: better characterized output (/ after directories, * after executable, @ after symbolic link)
# -h: better readable: use kB, MB, ...
# -a: all
alias ls='ls -GFha'

## Directory navigation
alias ..="cd .." 		# Move up one directory
alias ...="cd ../.." 		# Move up two directories
alias ....="cd ../../.." 	# Move up three directories

alias -- -="cd - >/dev/null"	# Revisit the previous directory, redirecting output to the null device
				# Doesn't work with alias - (since bash then thinks a flag is missing)
